#  JS Framework Comparative Analysis

## Framework Name (Svelte)

Research Conducted By: Camilla Rees and Elias Staele

### Overall Score and Comments
Score (Out of 10): 4
General Comments
We worked in front-end, using script and style tags

#### Pros
- some components were pretty well pre-designed
- starter code for components was well-made

#### Cons
- felt really extra
- biased towards TypeScript if you don't want to use it
- little variety for styling, few color options, etc.

### Ratings and Reviews

1. Documentation
Overall, it was okay. It wanted us to use TypeScript which we initially attempted to implement, but then installed a TypeScript ignore instead

2. Systems Requirements
We had to install Svelte, svelte carbon components, and ts ignore to our dependencies

3. Ramp-Up Projections
If we had more time to figure this out, it probably would have taken a view more days, or even weeks, depending on what you want to accomplish. What we did was limited so we only know what we know, and don't know what we don't.

4. Community Support and Adoption levels
This frameword doesn't seem too popular. It's probably more popular with TypeScript users.

## Problem Domain

### Implement Salmon Cookies in a New Framework

Your friend Pat has come up with a business idea by combining his love for sweets and his passion for healthy ecosystems. Pat has developed a recipe for a coffee-time confection called Salmon Cookies. These cookies made into the shape of a salmon and are suitable for both humans and salmon to enjoy.

Pat needs some help with the branding of the business, as well as some help with internal data management for the company, and has enlisted your assistance because of your extensive and proven work in developing web applications.

Patâ€™s Salmon Cookies, soon with franchises internationally, needs a proof of concept application to calculate the number of cookies each location must make every day so that it can manage its supplies inventory and baking schedule. The number of cookies to make depends on the hours of operation (6:00 AM to 8:00 PM for all locations) and a few factors unique to each location:

The minimum number of customers per hour.
The maximum number of customers per hour.
The average number of cookies purchased per customer.
Because we are early in the life of this business, we will need to build an application that is adaptable. Pat will need to be able to add and remove locations from the daily projections report, and Pat will also need to be able to easily modify the input numbers for each location based on day of the week, special events, and other factors. Pat would like to see these numbers with nice formatting in a web application.

Pat needs you to take a leading role in doing the design work and construction of a public-facing page, too. They already have a logo image picked out (below), but Pat is requesting your assistance in the design of the documents, color scheme, fonts, and any additional images for the public facing site.
